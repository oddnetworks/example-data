# Example data for a NASA channel

Contained in this directory is a single script called `seed.js` that exports a function. This function takes in the `bus` from [oddcast](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddcast), which is a dependency of [oddworks](https://github.com/oddnetworks/oddworks).

In a nutshell, this function will get all of the nested json files within this directory and then use the bus to send "commands" to any listening observers.

More to come...
